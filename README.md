# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree implementation using ID3 algorithm

This implementation of the decision tree finds the **root node** amongst all the attributes specified in the CSV(Comma spearated values) input file. 

There are two executable python files namely:
1) data_loader.py
2) decision-tree.py

The **data_loader.py** file reads the csv file. By default, the delimited is considered as a comma(',') but you can specify any delimiter of your choice in the code.

Run the **decision-tree.py** file while keeping in mind that the **csv file(DTree.csv)** is in the same directory as these files. You can edit the DTree.csv file according to your requirements or use an altogther different file by changing the filename in the code itself. 

The **tree-result.py** file contains the output of the inital commit of the project.
